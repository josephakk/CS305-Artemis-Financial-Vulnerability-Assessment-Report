# CS305-Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that helps their clients create financial guidance plans. They are attempting to modernize their
operations and enhance their security on their web application. 

I believe I did a pretty good job of updating the dependencies when I found that they were out of date. I also believe that I did a good job of 
creating and implementing keys. Security helps to keep a companies private data secured, which in turn can help increase their credebility in their field
and gain customers trust. Personally, I found that trying to discover which vulnerabilites were false positives to be the hardest part.
I increased layers of security by trying to add an input verification layer, as well as updating the dependencies that I found were out of date. 
I found the national vulnerability database (NVD) to be a huge asset when trying to learn about vulnerabilities and what they mean. The OWASP dependency check
that I conducted provided me with the CVE codes that I needed to review to understand the areas that my program were vulnerable.
